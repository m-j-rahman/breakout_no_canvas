TO DO LIST

- turn all key checks into a big switch case if possible, may be a bit of a pain to refactor
- make ball start movement random instead of set path
- centre the grid, title, and menus
- speed up paddle when the key is initally pressed
- flesh out the scoring system?
    - higher up bricks worth more points
    - combo bonus for more then one brick removed on a single trip
- sound effects when the ball hits something, or when the bricks are removed

Dev Tool/Performance tasks
- no frame drops, FPS must stay at same number
- FPS 50 - 60
- run Dev Tool rendering the paint ON, paint must be used very little
- run Dev Tool rendering the layer ON, layers must be used very little
- Is layer creation being promoted properly? https://web.dev/stick-to-compositor-only-properties-and-manage-layer-count/
